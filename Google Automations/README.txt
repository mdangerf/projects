***This automation service requires python and selenium to be 
   installed on the local machine.***
=================================================================
To use this script, First install python from 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once installed run (pip install selenium) in cmd

Some additional steps may be required to in order to run the 
scripts from your local machine.

There are instructions in the scripts and batch file as in
unique EMAIL and PASSWORD that are clearly labeled for you
to change.

I have provided the neccesary files to use the scripts. Simply
drag the files into a new pycharm project folder.

                         ***Reminder***
The purpose of this project is to inform you of the possibilities
of automation of the internet. This is not a step-by-step
tutorial but rather a simplified version of how this may
work for you. Some knowledge is required to use these scripts
and you might need to look a few things up if you intend on
using these scripts. I have done the tedious work and left
you with a nice interface to input you information to make
your life a little easier. Think smarter not harder. Why
do extra when it's not needed? If you want to use these scripts
and need help, consult me at me email: mdangerf@citadel.edu
